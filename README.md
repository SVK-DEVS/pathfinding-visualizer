# Pathfinding-Visualizer

A visualization tool for different pathfinding algorithms. Walls are impassable and the weight of a cell specifies the cost of getting to that cell. The purpose of this project was to gain practical experience with React whilst also providing a user friendly experience for mobile users.

## Demonstration

https://alexarne.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/

## Algorithms

## Expandability

The available algorithms and cell types are easily expanded by modifying the corresponding files in [utils](./src/utils/).

## Bugs

* When visiting the site on mobile, the initial grid will not cover the entire screen if the keyboard was open during the page load (such as when typing the website address). To fix this, make sure to close the keyboard before visiting.

## Deployment

Deployed to GitHub Pages using [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/XhoWXhyuW_I).
